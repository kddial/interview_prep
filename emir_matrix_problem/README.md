# Question:
Given an NxN matrix of positive and negative integers, 
write code to find the sub matrix with the largest possible sum.


To run solution:
```
python3 solution.py
```

Solution output:
```
--------------- Test Case ---------------
The full matrix is the following...
     -1      1      1
     -1     11      1
     -1      1     -3

Below is the submatrix with the largest sum of 14
             1      1
            11      1
                     
```
